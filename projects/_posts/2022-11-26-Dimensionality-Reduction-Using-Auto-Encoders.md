title: Dimensionality Reduction Using Auto-Encoders
abstract: The problem with high dimensional data is that it means high computational cost to perform learning and it often leads to over-fitting when learning a model. Due to this reason, we have dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data. It helps in data compression, reduces computation time and helps remove redundant features, if any. 
In this project, we shall be comparing two methods of dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) and auto encoders by applying them over a variety of datasets.
